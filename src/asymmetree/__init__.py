# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-"""AsymmeTree - Simulation of complex gene familiesAsymmeTree is an open-source Python library for the simulation and analysis ofphylogenetic scenarios. It includes a simulator for species and gene trees withheterogeneous evolution rates, nucleotide and amino acid sequences with orwithout indels, as well as whole genomes/proteomes.Moreover, it includes tools for the extraction of information from thesimulated scenarios such as orthology, best matches, and xenology, and a methodto estimate rooted species trees from an ensemble of orthology/paralogyrelations.The library is primarily designed to explore and validate mathematical concepts,and to test inference methods for various steps on the way to morerealistically-available data, i.e., dated gene trees, additive distances ofgene sets, noisy distances and finally sequences."""
