It includes a simulator for species and gene trees withheterogeneous evolution rates, nucleotide and amino acid sequences with orwithout indels, as well as whole genomes/proteomes.Moreover, it includes a matplotlib-based visualization of the simulated treesas well as tools for the extraction of information from the simulated scenariossuch as orthology, best matches, and xenology.The library is primarily designed to explore and validate mathematical concepts,and to test inference methods for various steps on the way to morerealistically-available data, i.e., dated gene trees, additive distances ofgene sets, noisy distances and finally sequences."""
